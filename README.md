# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
Jennifer has asked me to take on a large project. I have been tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. I will be using a dataset on video game reviews and using PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, I will be using PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset. Then, youâ€™ll write a summary of the analysis for Jennifer to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.


## Results
- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

- How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars? 

- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
